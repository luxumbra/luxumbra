### Hi. I'm luxumbra.
I have been doing this stuff for a while now (2001). I returned to coding a couple of years ago after a ~3 year career break and have beeen contracting and freelancing full-time since early 2019. I love tech and nature and I dream of living offgrid. During lockdown discovered Web3 & the utility of cryptocurrency beyond Bitcoin and I lept down the rabbit hole. 

The Ethereum and general Web3 community is amazing and I plan to spend more time working on interesting opensource projects in the Web3 / Crypto space and would love to shift the balance to these sort of projects in 2021.
